## Introduction to Linux Mint

Linux Mint is a computer operating system designed to work on most modern systems, including typical x86 and x64 PCs. 

Linux Mint can be thought of as filling the same role as Microsoft's Windows, Apple's Mac OS, and the free BSD OS. Linux Mint is also designed to work in conjunction with other operating systems (including those listed above), and can automatically set up a “dual boot” or “multi-boot” environment (where the user is prompted as to which operating system to start at each boot-up) during its installation.  

Linux Mint is a great operating system for individuals and for companies. 

### History

Linux Mint is a very modern operating system; Its development started in 2006. It is, however, built upon very mature and proven software layers, including the Linux kernel, the GNU tools and the MATE desktop. It also relies on the Ubuntu and Debian projects and uses their systems as a base.

The Linux Mint project focuses on making the desktop more usable and more efficient for everyday tasks performed by regular users. Underneath the desktop the operating system also provides a huge collection of available software and a very well integrated set of services. 

Linux Mint saw a rapid rise in popularity and more and more people use it every day. 

### Purpose

The purpose of Linux Mint is to provide a desktop operating system that home users and companies can use at no cost and which is as efficient, easy to use, and elegant as possible. 
One of the ambitions of the Linux Mint project is to become the best operating system available by making it easy for people to get to use advanced technologies, rather than by simplifying them (and thereby reducing their capabilities), or by copying the approaches taken by other developers. 
The goal is to develop our own idea of the ideal desktop. We think that it is best to make the most out of the modern technologies that exist under Linux and make it easy for everybody to use its most advanced features. 

### Version numbers and codenames 

Version numbers and codenames follow a unique logic in Linux Mint: 

- Codenames provide a way to refer to versions of Linux Mint that is more familiar than using a version number.
- Since version 5, Linux Mint has followed a 6 months release cycle and uses a simplified version scheme. The version number simply gets incremented every 6 months. 
- If revisions are made to a particular release (a bit like Service Packs in Windows)  its version number gets a minor revision increment. For instance “3” becomes “3.1”.
- Codenames in Linux Mint are always female names ending with “a”. They follow the alphabetical order and the first letter of the codename corresponds to the index of the version number in the alphabet. 

So far Linux Mint has used the following codenames:

| Version | Codename |
| ------- | -------- |
| 1.0     | Ada      |
| 2.0     | Barbara  |
| 2.1     | Bea      |
| 2.2     | Bianca   |
| 3.0     | Cassandra|
| 3.1     | Celena   |
| 4.0     | Daryna   |
| 5       | Elyssa   |
| 6       | Felicia  |
| 7       | Gloria   |
| 8       | Helena   |
| 9       | Isadora  |
| 10      | Julia    |
| 11      | Katya    |
| 12      | Lisa     |
| 13      | Maya     |

### Editions

An Edition is a release of Linux Mint which is customized to address a certain set of needs. This guide covers the MATE Edition. Here are some of the most popular editions: 

- MATE Edition (uses a MATE desktop)
- Cinnamon Edition (uses a Cinnamon desktop)
- KDE Edition (uses a KDE desktop)
- Xfce Edition (uses an Xfce desktop)

If you don’t know which edition to use, you should choose the MATE Edition.

Note: If you intend to redistribute or to make commercial use of Linux Mint in the USA or in Japan and if you’re not sure about patent legislation you should use the “CD No Codecs”  installation images.

### Where to find help

The Linux Mint community is very helpful and very active. If you have questions or a problem related to Linux Mint, you should be able to get help from other users online. 
First, make sure to register with the “Linux Mint Forums”. This is the very first place where you can find help: [http://www.linuxmint.com/forum](http://www.linuxmint.com/forum).

If you want to chat with other users you can connect to the IRC chat room. Under Linux Mint simply launch “XChat” from the menu. If you’re using another operating system or another IRC client make sure to connect to the “irc.spotchat.org” server and to join the channels “#linuxmint-help” and “#linuxmint-chat”. 

Linux Mint uses Ubuntu repositories (more on what this means later) and is fully compatible with it so most of the resources, articles, tutorials, and software made for Ubuntu also work for Linux Mint. If you can’t find help on a specific subject, make sure to search on the same subject for Ubuntu. 

Note: Ubuntu is another operating system based on GNU/Linux.

Note: A repository is an online service by which software is stored and made available for the operating system to install and update from. Most operating systems based on GNU/Linux use repositories and connect to them via HTTP or FTP to install and upgrade their software.

Linux Mint简介
Linux Mint 是一种工作在包括典型的X86和X64架构PC在内的现代系统上的电脑操作系统。
Linux Mint 可以被看做是和微软Windows、苹果Mac OS、免费的 BSD OS充当一样角色的操作系统。Linux Mint可以和其它系统协同工作（包括上面列出的在内），也可以在安装过程中自动安装双启动或者多启动环境（每次启动时会提示用户选择启动的操作系统）。
History

历史
Linux Mint 是一种非常现代的操作系统，它开发源于2006年，尽管如此，Linux Mint却是建立在成熟且经过验证的包括Linux内核、GNU工具、MATE桌面在内的软件层上。Linux Mint依赖Ubuntu和Debian项目并且使用它们的系统作为基础。
Linux Mint 项目专注于为普通用户处理日常任务提供一个更易用、更高效的桌面系统。系统也在桌面底层提供了大量可用软件集合和高度集成的服务。
Linux Mint的人气增长很快，每天有越来越多的人开始使用Linux Mint。
Purpose
The purpose of  Linux Mint is to provide a desktop operating system that home users and companies can use at no cost and whtich is efficient ,easy to use, and elegant as possible.
One of the ambitions of  the Linux Mint project is to become the best operating system available by making it easy for people to get use advanced technologies, rather than by simplifying them (and thereby reducing their capablities), or by copying the approaches taken by other developers.
The goal is to develop our own idea of  the ideal destop. We think that it is best to make the most out of  the modern technologies that exist under Linux and make it easy for everbody to use its most advanced features.
目标：
Linux Mint的目标是为家庭用户和公司用户提供一个免费、高效、易用、优雅的桌面操作系统。
Linux Mint的愿望之一是成为最好的操作系统，实现这个愿望的途径是通过使用户更容易掌握高级的技术而不是简化它们（这样会削弱它们的性能）或者抄袭其他开发者的方法。
我们的目标是开发出心中最理想的桌面系统。我们认为最好可以充分利用Linux下面的最新技术并且让每一个人都能轻松地使用最高级的特性。

So far Linux Mint has used the following codenames:















Version	Codename

版本号和开发代号
Linux Mint的版本号和开发代号遵循一个特殊的逻辑：
开发代号提供一个相比使用版本号更熟悉的方法来体现Linux Mint的版本。
从Linux 5开始，Linux Mint开始遵循6个月为一个发行周期并且使用简化的版本计划。简化后的版本号每6个月增加一次。
如果针对特定的版本发布了修订版（类型于Windows下面的Service Packs 服务包），它的版本号后面会增加一个小数。比如版本“3”变成版本“3.1”。
Linux Mint的开发代号一直是以“a”为结尾的女性名字。它们遵循字母顺序，并且开发代号的第一个字母和版本号在字母表中的索引是一致的。
目前Linux Mint已经使用了下面的开发代号：









版本	开发代号
1.0	Ada
2.0	Barbara
2.1	Bea
2.2	Bianca
3.0	Cassandra
3.1	Celena
4.0	Daryna

版本
版本是Linux Mint根据不同需求定制的不同发行版，本用户手册是针对MATE版的。下面是一些最流行的版本：
.MATE版（使用MATE桌面）
.Cinnamon版（使用Cinnamon桌面）
.KDE版（使用KDE桌面）
.Xfce版（使用Xfce桌面）
如果你不知道选择使用哪个版本，你应该选择MATE版。
注释：如果你想重新发布Linux Mint或者在美国日本将Linux Mint用于商业用途并且你不清楚专利法规，你应该使用“CD NO Codecs”安装镜像。
如何获取帮助
Linux Mint社区非常有帮助并且非常活跃，如果你有Linux Mint相关问题或者难题，你应该能从其他在线用户那获得帮助。
首先，确认注册了“LinuxMint 论坛”，这是你能获得帮助的第一个地方：http://www.Linuxmint.com/forum 
译者注：国内用户可以到Linux Mint中文（http://www.linuxmint.net/）寻求帮助
如果你想和其他用户交流你可以连接到IRC聊天室。在Linux Mint下只需要从菜单栏中启动“Xchat”就可以了。如果你使用其他的操作系统或者别的IRC客户端，确保连接到“irc.spotchat.org”服务器并且加入到“#linuxmint-help”和“#linuxmint-chat”频道。
Linux Mint 使用Ubuntu的软件源（稍后会有详解）并且和Ubuntu完全兼容，因此Ubuntu上面的绝大部分资源、文章、教程和软件都适用于Linux Mint。如果你无法获得针对某个特定问题的帮助。可以搜索Ubuntu下面相同的问题。
注：Ubuntu是另外一款基于GNU/Linux的操作系统。
注：软件源是一种提供软件存储和系统安装以及升级功能的在线服务。绝大部分基于GNU/Linux的操作系统使用软件源，并且通过HTTP或者FTP连接到软件源来安装和升级软件。
