您是否充分利用了您的电脑？您是否经常使用“CTRL+C”来复制文本？您有时是否需要打开一个文本编辑器来做一些快速的笔记？您怎样和您的朋友们分享文件？有很多方法可以完成这些简单的任务，但是我们需要更高效的。为了使您更好的利用好您的电脑，这一章我们将向您展示Linux桌面系统（比如：Linux Mint Desktop）一些高级特性。

### Copy and paste with the mouse
### 使用鼠标复制与粘贴

Most people are used to clicking on the “Edit” menu or to right clicking on the content they want to copy. In Linux Mint you can do this as well, but most GNU/Linux operating systems also let you copy and paste content from the comfort of your mouse. Here's how it works: The left button of the mouse copies and the middle button pastes. It's as simple as that!

大多数朋友通常会点击“编辑”菜单或者在选中的内容上右击来完成复制操作。在Linux Mint下您当然也可以用上述的方法来完成复制，但在GNU/Linux类操作系统下，您可以通过舒服的鼠标来完成复制与粘贴。方法如下：用鼠标左键选中您要复制的内容，再使用鼠标中键完成粘贴操作。操作就是这么简单。

Let's give it a try. Launch LibreOffice Writer or a text editor, or any application of your choice that lets you input text. Now type a few sentences. Select some of the text you just typed with the left button of your mouse. Think you need to click on the “Edit” menu and press “Copy”? No? Bet you're thinking you would use a combination of keys on your keyboard such as “CTRL+C”. In Linux, it is much simpler. Just by selecting the text, you've already copied it. That's right... that text is now copied to your “mouse buffer” and you don't need to press anything else. 

让我们来试试。首先您先打开任何一个允许您输入文字的应用程序，如LibreOffice Writer或一个文本编辑器等。然后您就可以输入一些句子。若此时您需要复制一些文字，您可能会点击“编辑”菜单下的“复制”按钮，不是这样？那我敢打赌，您肯定会想到使用键盘上的组合键“CTRL+C”来完成复制。其实，在Linux下，有更简单的方法。您只需要使用鼠标选中这些文字，您就已经复制好了。选中的这些文字会被拷贝到您的“鼠标缓冲区”中。

Now click on some other part of the document to move the cursor there and click the middle button of your mouse (or the wheel-click if you have a mouse with a wheel, or both the left and right buttons together if your mouse only has two buttons... everything's been thought of, apart from those weird Mac mice with only one button). As you can see the text you previously selected has now been pasted. 

现在您可以将鼠标移动到这篇文档的其他位置，然后点击鼠标中键（如果您的鼠标是带有滑轮的，就按下鼠标滑轮；如果您的鼠标只有左右两个键，就同时按下这两个键；所有情况都被考虑到了，除了只有一个按键的神奇的Mac鼠标例外）。正好您所看到的，先前被选中的文档已经粘贴到光标处。

The more you get used to this the faster you'll get at copying and pasting content. This technique also works on most Unix and GNU/Linux operating systems. 

经常使用这种方法，您就可以更快的复制与粘贴。这种方法在大多数UNIT和GNU/Linux操作系统下都是有效的。

Note: The buffer used by the mouse is not the same as the one used by the MATE desktop. So you can actually copy something with your mouse and copy something else with “CTRL+C” or with the “Edit” menu. Thanks to this you can copy two elements at a time and depending on how you copied them you can paste them with either the middle mouse button or with “CTRL+V” or the “Edit” menu. 

注意：鼠标使用的缓冲区与MATE桌面使用的缓冲区是不一样的。所以您可以使用鼠标来复制，也可以使用“CTRL+C”或“编辑”菜单来复制，由于它们使用的缓冲区是不一样的，相当于同一时刻有两份不一样的拷贝，此时，您可以使用鼠标粘贴，也可以“CTRL+V”或“编辑”菜单来完成粘贴。

### Takes notes with Tomboy
### 使用Tomboy（阿帖便笺）来做笔记

We all take notes. Whether it's an address given by someone over the phone, an ever-growing TODO list or some particular thing to remember, we're often faced with the situation where we need to take a quick note. Some of us have a lot of written notes around our computers and never seem to find a working pen when the situation arises, others waste time in launching tools that are not suitable for this particular use (LibreOffice Writer for instance is not very handy to take notes) and very few people actually use software dedicated to note-taking. Linux Mint happens to include a dedicated note-taking tool. It is called Tomboy Notes.

我们都需要做笔记。我们也经常会遇到需要做一些快速笔记的情形，比如在在通话时需要记录某人的地址，也可能需要记录一个增长的TODO列表或者是一些需要记住的特殊事情。我们中的一些人电脑旁放了好多便签，但在遇到上述紧急情况的时候却找不到一支笔；其他一些人把时间浪费在启动工具上，而这种工具却不适合这种场合（举例来说，在这种情况下使用LibreOffice Writer来做笔记就不是很方便）；极少数人会使用专门针对记笔记开发的软件。幸运的是，Linux Mint碰巧有一款专用的记笔记工具。它的名称是Tomboy Notes（阿帖便笺）。

Tomboy Notes is a very easy tool to use. By clicking on it you get a list of all your notes. You can create new notes by clicking on “Create New Note”. 

Tomboy Notes使用起来很简单。通过打开它，您会获得您的笔记列表。您可以点击“创建新笔记”来新建一个笔记。

A new note opens up. By changing its title you'll also change its name. You can write whatever you want in the note and close it. The content you wrote in your note will always be accessible through Tomboy Notes; You don't need to save anything and you can even reboot or turn off the computer. Again, your note is saved automatically as you're writing it. 

打开一个新的笔记。您可以修改它的名字来改变标题。在笔记上您可以写任何东西，然后关闭它。通过Tomboy Notes，您总是可以获得您在笔记 中所记录的内容。当您记笔记的时候，它是自动保存的。您没必要保存，您甚至可以重启或者关闭电脑。

If you eventually decide that you no longer need to keep a particular note, you can open that note and click on the “Delete” button. 

如果您最终决定不再保留一个特定的笔记，您可以打开这个笔记并且点击“删除”按钮。

If you write down the name of another note's title within your note, Tomboy will automatically create a link to that other note and you'll be able to click that link to open the other note. 

在笔记中如果您写下另一个笔记标题的名称，Tomboy会自动创建一个链接，此时，您就可以点击这个链接打开那个笔记。

You can also use different formatting options within your note and use the many features provided by Tomboy Notes (synchronization, search features, export notes to PDF/HTML...etc). 

在笔记中您也可以使用不同的格式选项和Tomboy提供的很多特性（比如同步，搜索，导出笔记成PDF或者HTML格式等）。
