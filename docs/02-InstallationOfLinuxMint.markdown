## Installation of Linux Mint

## Linux Mint的安装
You can download the Linux Mint operating system for free. It comes as an ISO file which you need to burn to a blank DVD. The liveDVD is then bootable and provides a fully-functional operating system which you can try without affecting your PC. In layman's terms, when you put Linux Mint on a DVD and place it into your computer, you can try it out while leaving your current system intact. 

您可以免费下载Linux Mint操作系统。所提供下载的是一个ISO文件，所以您需要将其刻录入一张空白DVD中。然后便可用此liveDVD启动系统，同时它也提供了全功能操作系统而对您的电脑却毫无影响。通俗地讲，当您将Linux Mint刻入DVD中并将其插入到电脑，进行试用时对您当前的系统没有丝毫的影响。

Note: It is also possible to write the ISO image to a USB stick or other memory device and boot from that, or to boot from the ISO image on the hard drive, but these options are somewhat more advanced and the method presented here is recommended. For help with alternative methods of installing and running Linux Mint, please visit the forums.

注意：亦可将ISO镜像写入到U盘或者其他存储设备中，然后从这些设备启动系统，或者从硬盘上的ISO镜像文件直接启动，但这些是较高级的选择，我们更推荐您使用本文呈现的方法安装系统。欲寻求安装和运行Linux Mint的其他备选方法，请访问论坛。

If you like what you see when running the liveDVD you can decide to install the system to your hard drive. All the necessary tools (partitioning and installation tools) are present on the DVD.
 
如果您喜欢运行liveDVD时所见的一切，可以考虑将此系统直接安装到您的硬盘上。DVD中包含了所有需要的工具（包括分区及安装工具）。

### Download the ISO
## 下载ISO文件

Note: If you don't have a broadband connection, or if your Internet access is too slow you can order the DVD from this web site: [http://www.osdisc.com](http://www.osdisc.com)

Otherwise, you can visit the Linux Mint download page here: [http://www.linuxmint.com/download.php](http://www.linuxmint.com/download.php)

Then choose the edition you're interested in.

注意：如果您没有宽带连接，或者联网速度很慢，可以在这个网站上订购DVD光盘，网址是：[http://www.osdisc.com](http://www.osdisc.com)

此外，您也可以访问Linux Mint的下载页面：
[http://www.linuxmint.com/download.php](http://www.linuxmint.com/download.php)

然后选择您感兴趣的版本进行下载。

From this page, you should be able to find: 

- an MD5 signature
- a torrent link
- a list of download mirrors

在此网页，您应该能看到：

- 一个MD5签名
- 一个种子下载链接
- 一个镜像下载列表


The file you need to download is an ISO file. There are two ways to download this file, by torrent (a Peer to Peer protocol) or via a download mirror (HTTP or FTP protocol). Once your download is finished, you can ensure your ISO file isn’t corrupted by checking its signature with the MD5. 

您需要下载的是一个ISO文件。有两种途径来下载此文件，通过BT（点对点协议）或者镜像下载（HTTP或FTP协议）进行文件下载。一旦下载完成，您可以通过检查其MD5签名来确保ISO文件没有被毁坏。

#### Via Torrent
#### 通过BT下载

Torrent is a Peer to Peer (P2P) protocol. Basically, instead of downloading from a central location, a torrent lets you download the ISO file in parts from different people across the Internet. 

BT是一种点对点（P2P）协议。从本质来讲，种子文件使得您可以跨越网络从不同人的手中下载ISO文件的部分文件，而并非从一个中心位置直接下载。

The more people who download the ISO file, the faster the download speed gets. This is the preferred and recommended way to download Linux Mint.

下载此ISO文件的人越多，下载的速度就越快。这是下载Linux Mint的首选方式，同时也是我们推崇的方法。
 

##### Install a Torrent client
#### 安装BT客户端

You need a piece of software called a “torrent client” in order to download files via torrent.

If you run Linux, you can install “Transmission”. If you run Linux Mint, Transmission is already installed. 

If you run Windows, you can use Vuze ( [http://azureus.sourceforge.net/](http://azureus.sourceforge.net/) ).

为了能够通过BT下载文件，您需要安装一款BT客户端软件。

如果您运行的是Linux系统，可以安装“Transmission”这款软件。如果运行的是Linux Mint，就不必费心啦，因为Transmission早就被预置安装了。

如果是Windows，您可以使用Vuze
（[http://azureus.sourceforge.net/](http://azureus.sourceforge.net/)）。


##### Download the Torrent file
####下载种子文件

The next step is to follow the torrent link from the Linux Mint website and to download the .torrent file. This file is very small. After it downloads, you should open it with your torrent client. 

The torrent client will probably ask you where you want to save the ISO. Select a destination and then wait for the download to complete. 

For more information about the torrent protocol, visit: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent)

下一步就是通过Linux Mint网页中的种子链接去下载后缀为.torrent的种子文件。文件很小，下载完成后，您得用BT客户端才能打开它。

BT客户端将可能会询问您欲将ISO文件存往何处。请选择一个目标文件夹，然后耐心地等待下载完成吧。

欲获更多BT协议信息，请访问网站：
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent)

#### Via a download mirror
####通过镜像下载

If you can’t, or do not choose to use the torrent protocol, then look at the list of download mirrors and pick one of them. They’ll provide a link to the ISO file itself which you can just click to start the download. 

如果您不能或者不愿选择BT协议下载镜像，就来看看镜像下载列表并在里面随心挑一个吧。它们自身将会提供一个ISO文件的下载链接，您只需轻轻一点即可开始下载了。


Note: Remember that bandwidth is limited though and the more people download from a mirror, the slower the download speed gets for everybody who is downloading from that mirror. Furthermore, if for some reason the download should be interrupted, it may be corrupted and the download may have to be restarted. For these reasons it might be worthwhile using a download manager, like for Linux, or for Windows, if taking this route.

注意：别忘了带宽总是会受限制的，而且下载同一镜像的人越多，每个人获取镜像的速度就越慢。此外，如果因为某些原因导致下载中断，镜像可能会因此毁坏而让您不得不重新下载。考虑到诸多因素，如果采取这种途径，不管对Linux还是Windows，使用下载管理器都意义非凡。

### Read the Release Notes
###阅读发行说明

Your download is probably going to last at least an hour, so now would be the perfect time for you to get familiar with the new features coming with the release you’re currently downloading. 

下载将可能持续至少一个小时，所以现在是您熟悉您正在下载的发行版系统新特性的绝佳时机。
The release notes are featured on the Linux Mint web page and answer the following questions:

- What are the new features delivered in this release?
- What are the known problems of this release?
- How do I upgrade from the previous release?

发行说明位于Linux Mint官方网页的重要位置，它主要回答了一下几个问题：

- 在此发行版中友哪些新增特性？
- 此发行版存在哪些已知的问题？
- 如何从前一版本进行升级？

They also contain screenshots of the latest release. Of course, you could find out about most features highlighted in the release notes by simply using the operating system, but you might miss a few things, so it is most reliable to read the release notes. 

其中也包括了最新发行版的屏幕截图。当然，您可以直接使用此系统来发掘发行说明中提及的重点突显的特性，但您也可能会错失一些东西，所以还是乖乖阅读一下发行说明吧。

The release notes for Linux Mint 13 Maya are available here: [http://www.linuxmint.com/rel_maya.php](http://www.linuxmint.com/rel_maya.php)

Linux Mint 13 May的发行说明可在此获得：

### Check the MD5
###校验MD5

You’ve read the release notes, you just can’t wait to play with the new features or try Linux Mint, and your download just finished successfully. You’re ready to burn a DVD and to boot on it… but hey! Wait for a second! 

阅读完发行日志，您已经等不及想体验这些新特性或者使用Linux Mint了吧，刚好此时镜像下载也刚完成。现在就可以准备刻录光盘然后启动系统……但是，稍安勿躁！

If that DVD is faulty you will experience weird bugs and will have a lot of trouble finding help. The two most common reasons for a DVD to be faulty are:

- An issue with the download causing problems in your ISO file
- An error during the burn process that alters the contents of your burned liveDVD 

如果那张DVD有错误，您将会遇到诡异问题，而且寻求帮助时也会遇到很多麻烦。导致DVD有误的最常见两个原因是：

- 下载过程中的问题导致了ISO文件的错误
- 刻录过程中的错误改变了liveDVD内容的改变

The MD5 signature, which is present on the download page, provides a quick way for you to make sure that your ISO file is exactly like it should be. So, let’s check the ISO file you just downloaded before we burn it and save ourselves from a lot of potential problems. 

下载页面上的MD5签名为确保您下载的ISO文件完整无误提供了一条快捷的途径。所以，在我们刻录前先对已下载的文件进行MD5校验以避免那些潜伏的问题。

If you run any version of Linux you probably already have the md5sum program installed. Open a terminal and “cd” to the directory where your ISO file is (for instance, if “linuxmint.iso” is on the Desktop), open a terminal and type:
 
如果您运行了其他版本的Linux，可能已经安装了md5sum程序。打开终端并使用“cd”命令切换到ISO文件所在目录（比如，假设“linuxmint.iso”文件在桌面上），开启终端并键入：


    cd ~/Desktop
    md5sum linuxmint.iso
    
This command should output a series of numbers and letters which comprise the MD5 sum, or signature, of your ISO file. By design, any small change to the ISO file will cause this signature to be significantly different, allowing us to verify that the file is exactly as it should be.

这条命令应该会输出一串数字和字母，其中包含了您的ISO文件的MD5校验和或MD5值。依照设计，任何小的改动都将引起MD5值的明显改变，这样我们就能验证文件没有被篡改过。

Compare that signature with the one on the download page of the Linux Mint website. If the two signatures are the same, then you know your ISO file is exactly the same as the original and you can now get ready to burn it on DVD 

将这个MD5值与Linux Mint网站下载页面的值进行比较。如果两者相同，那么您的ISO文件就没问题，现在您就可以准备将它刻录到DVD上啦。

If you happen to run Windows, chances are you don’t have md5sum installed. You can get it from here: [http://www.etree.org/md5com.html](http://www.etree.org/md5com.html)

如果碰巧您运行的是Windows，那么可能没有安装md5sum。可以从这里下载：
[http://www.etree.org/md5com.html](http://www.etree.org/md5com.html)

Place the ISO file and the md5sum.exe in the same place (let’s say in C:\) and run “cmd.exe”. In the command line environment, type the following commands: 

请将ISO文件和md5sum.exe放在同一目录下（假设在C:\），然后运行“cmd.exe”。在命令行环境中，键入如下命令：

    C:
    cd \
    md5sum linuxmint.iso
    
Then compare the signature to the one present on the website. 

然后将这个值与网页上的MD5值进行比较。

### Burn the ISO to DVD
### 将ISO刻录至DVD 

Now that you have checked the ISO file with MD5, you are ready to burn it to a DVD. 

现在您已经用MD5对ISO文件进行了校验，就可以把它刻录到DVD上了。

Note: Linux Mint also provides images which fit on 700MB CDs. If you can't burn DVDs please use the CD images instead. 

注意：Linux Mint同样提供了适合700MB CD的镜像文件。如果您无法进行DVD刻录，请使用CD镜像。

Get a blank DVD-R (a DVD-RW should work as well, but this type of media is known to have compatibility issues) and your favorite marker and label the DVD. Although labeling your DVDs sounds trivial, you should be sure to do so, as you can easily end up with 20 unlabeled and unidentifiable discs on your desk. :)

取一个空白的DVD-R（DVD-RW也行，但这种类型的介质会牵扯到兼容性问题），还有您最喜欢的标签，把它贴在DVD上做标记。虽然做标记看起来挺微不足道，但您也应该不厌其烦地做好，否则桌上若有20张无标签的光盘，您将该凌乱了。:)

Insert the blank DVD-R in the drive and get ready to burn the ISO. 

将空白DVD-R插入光驱，然后准备ISO镜像的刻录工作。

If you’re running Linux with MATE right-click on the ISO file and select “Write to Disc”. 

If you’re running Linux with KDE, launch K3B and in the “Tools” menu choose “Write ISO Image”. 

If you're running Linux and would like to use the terminal, from the directory you have downloaded the image to:

如果您运行的是Linux Gnome桌面，请右击ISO文件并选择“写入磁盘”。

如果您运行的是Linux KED桌面，请启动K3B程序，然后在“工具”菜单中选择“写入ISO镜像”。

如果您运行Linux并且喜欢在终端中工作，进入您下载镜像的目录，运行如下命令：

    cdrecord -v -dao dev=1,0,0 linuxmint.iso
    
Replacing the numbers after dev= with the appropriate device number for your disc drive. You can run

用您适当的磁盘设备号替换dev=后面的数字。可以运行如下命令（需要root权限）找到设备号。

    cdrecord -scanbus
    
to find this out. You may need to be root to run these commands.

If you’re running Windows you can use a program like InfraRecorder:
[http://infrarecorder.sourceforge.net/?page_id=5](http://infrarecorder.sourceforge.net/?page_id=5)

如果您运行的是Windows，可以用类似InfraRecorder的刻录软件：
[http://infrarecorder.sourceforge.net/?page_id=5](http://infrarecorder.sourceforge.net/?page_id=5)


Note: Make sure to burn the ISO image to disk, and not to write the ISO file to the disk. A very common mistake, especially for people using Nero, is to actually burn the ISO file on the disk as a data file. The ISO file is an image of a disk so it needs to be burnt not as a file which will appear on the disk, but as an ISO image which will be decompressed and whose content will be burnt onto the disc. After burning the DVD you shouldn't see the ISO file within the disc, but rather folders like “casper” or “isolinux”. Most burning software has a special option for this. 

注意：请确定是将ISO镜像刻录到光盘，而不是将ISO文件写入光盘。一个极其普遍的错误，尤其是使用Nero的人们，会实际将ISO文件当做数据文件刻录到光盘中。ISO文件是磁盘的一个镜像，因此它不应被刻录成磁盘上的一个文件，而应该是一个被解压ISO镜像，其内容被刻录在光盘上。刻录完DVD后，在光盘中您不会看到ISO文件，而应是类似“casper”或者“isolinux”之类的目录文件。大部分刻录软件对此都有指定的选项。

### Boot the LiveDVD
###引导LiveDVD

Place the DVD in the drive and restart the computer. You should now see the following screen:

将DVD放入光驱中然后重启电脑。您将会看到以下界面：


Note: If you don’t see this screen and your PC boots as usual it’s probably because your BIOS is not set to boot on DVD. Restart the computer and press F1, F2, Delete, or Escape (or whatever key lets you enter the BIOS configuration) and change your BIOS settings to tell your computer to boot from its DVD drive. 

注意：如果您没有看到此界面并且您的电脑像以往一样正常启动，那么可能是由于您的BIOS没有设置为从DVD启动。重启电脑，按下F1，F2，Delete或者Escape键（或者其他能让您进入BIOS配置的键）然后修改您的BIOS设置以告知电脑从DVD驱动启动。

### Install Linux Mint on your Hard Drive

From the first screen choose the default “Start Linux Mint” option and press Enter. 

After a little while the live system should be ready and you should see the desktop:


At this stage Linux Mint is not installed on your computer, it’s simply running from the DVD. The system you have in front of you is, however, almost exactly the same as the one you will have on your computer after the installation is finished. 

Have fun with it and see if you like it. Bear in mind that when running from the DVD, Linux Mint runs significantly slower than it does when it is installed on a hard drive, since it has to read data from the DVD drive, which is a slower medium than the hard drive.

When you are ready, double-click on the “Install Linux Mint” icon located on the desktop. The Installer appears: 


If you haven’t read the release notes yet, and you have an Internet connection, then this an ideal opportunity to review them; simply click on the underlined link. It is highly recommended that users read the release notes prior to installation in order to advise themselves of new features, as well as any issues that might affect their particular hardware configuration.

Select your language and press the “Forward” button.



In the next screen, make sure you're connected to a power source (if you're using a laptop), the Internet and that you have the recommended amount of disk space. Then press the “Forward” button. 


In the next screen you can assign your entire hard drive to Linux Mint or install it alongside other operating systems. Alternatively, you can also define and assign the partitions manually. 

- If you choose to use the entire disk, its content will be erased and Linux Mint will be installed as the only operating system on your computer.
- If you choose to install it alongside other operating systems, the installer will use the free space available on other partitions to create a new one for Linux Mint. You will be asked how much space you want to allocate to it. The installer will then shrink a partition and take care of everything for you. Post-installation your computer will have a boot screen from which you'll be able to boot all your operating systems. 
- If you choose to specify partitions manually, a partition editor will appear, giving you full control over the partitioning of your hard drive. This is recommended only to advanced users who understand how partitioning works under Linux. Note that Linux Mint requires a partition of at least 6GB and that the recommended size for a swap partition is 1.5 times the amount of RAM available on the computer.

Choose the appropriate option and click on the “Forward” button.


The next screen asks you to confirm. When ready press the “Install Now” button to start the installation. 

At this stage, the installation is going on in the background and the installer asks you setup questions:



Choose your location on the map by clicking on the city which is the nearest to you. The purpose of this step is to identify your time zone. Make sure the “Current time” appears correctly and click the “Forward” button.

Note: Sometimes the installer doesn't properly handle Summer/Winter time adjustments, so even by selecting the proper city you might see a difference of an hour or so with the correct time. Simply ignore this at this stage and remember to make sure that the time is correct after you reboot in your newly installed Linux Mint desktop.



Select your keyboard layout. If you are not sure about exactly which layout matches the keyboard you have, click on the text field at the bottom of the screen and start typing with your keyboard. Make sure the keys you press match the characters that appear in the text field in order to ensure you have selected the right keyboard layout. Some layouts only differ with respect to accents, numbers and punctuation signs, so make sure to test these as well. 

When you’re ready click the “Forward” button. 


Enter your real name and a username and password. Every time you’ll use Linux Mint you’ll use your account with this username and password. Once Linux Mint is installed you’ll be able to define other accounts if other people are to use this computer. 
Also give your computer a name. This name will be used by your computer on the network or in various places of the system. If you’ve never really thought about naming your computers, then now is the time. People commonly pick flower (dahlia, rose, tulip) or planet (mars, jupiter, pluto) names for the computers on their network. It’s entirely up to you what you want to use, but make sure to pick a name you like and that you will easily remember. 

Note: Capital letters, spaces and special characters are not permitted in the username or in the name of the computer.

If you're the only one using the computer and you want to bypass the login screen, check the option “Log in automatically”.  

When you’re ready click on the “Forward” button. 


The installer might detect other operating systems on your computer and ask you if you want to migrate some personal information. Typically this allows you to migrate bookmarks, contacts, favorites and other sorts of personal information from other operating systems installed on your hard disk drive into the newly installed Linux Mint.

When you’re ready click on the “Forward” button. 




The installation should take between 10 and 15 minutes. 

Note: The installer will download packages from the Internet to support the language you’ve selected. Your computer needs to be connected to the Internet for this to work. Otherwise just “skip” that step and you’ll be able to add support for your language after the installation is finished and you’ve rebooted into your new system. 

Once the installation is done click the “Restart Now” button and the liveDVD environment will shut down. 

When prompted, remove the DVD from the drive and press Enter. 

Your PC is now ready to boot Linux Mint from the hard drive. 
The Boot sequence

Upon reboot, if you have more than one operating system installed, you should see a “boot menu”.

Once Linux Mint is finished loading you should see a new screen inviting you to enter your username and password. This screen is the “MDM Login Manager” and is commonly called “MDM”. Enter the password you chose during the installation.
 

Note: By default, your “root” password is the same as the password you chose during the installation. If you do not know what this means, then don't worry about it.
